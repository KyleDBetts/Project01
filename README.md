# Business Problem:

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has decided to enter the original video content production and streaming business similar to Netflix and Amazon Prime. The goal of this project is to analyze the movie data, determine the types of films that has shown success, and based on that make recommendations to Microsoft on the types of film ventures to pursue.

We assumed that Microsoft will be investing in and producing full feature films. The films will be available for distribution in movie theaters world-wide. At the same time, we assumed that Microsoft will launch a streaming platform service like Netflix and Amazon Prime, first starting out in the U.S., featuring Microsoft original films.


## Questions of Interest:

1. Which genre should we start with? (Which genre will generate the highest return on investment (ROI)?)
2. What is ideal crew to assemble? (Which directors, writers, and actors have the highest ROI?)
3. What movies will be highest grossing flims, regardless of budget? (Assuming that gaining ensuring large scale user traction for Microsoft's streaming service is the priority, irrespective of recovering the investment during the initial phase)  


# Dataset

The following dataset has been used in the analysis:
 - Box Office Mojo
 - IMDB
 - Rotten Tomatoes
 - TheMovieDB.org
 
 Every movie has a unique ID that ties to the title, the crew (directors & writers), the actors, the budget and the gross revenues, and genres.
